PASSWORD: password of the keystore
SERVICEPORT: the other server spark app port
PORT: the port for this server
MESSAGE: the message to display from this server
```
then you'll have to deploy an instance in AWS ec2 service, after that you'll have to clone the code and compile with:

```
mvn clean install
```

after that you'll have to run the spark web application with:
```
java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* edu.eci.aep.SparkWeb
```
and then the application will be running
